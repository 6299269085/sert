Hello everyone this is Rishav here  , today I want to share my thoughts on the very serious matter which is quite threatning for us(engineers) nowdays.
Guess what I am taking of , yup very correct I am taking of the AI. Its a fact that AI is doing too well in today's world it's proving it's worth not only it's worth even AI is proving that it's far better than we (humans)in many context. AI can code , WAP, develop,do some inovative things  and that's too precisely, effectively in less time with our communicating tone that's would appear to us very friendly and interactive.Logically taking It's good for us in a sence that we are having something that can make our life easy and us in many ways  but this sudden peak in the use of AI can lead to massive layoff as AI can replace many people in terms of simmiliar kind of skill sets that AI can do. So , definitely many companies will prefer to go with AI which is indeed beneficial for them . We can't do much more of that we should adapt to this advancing and developing era , we have to upgrade us , we should keep updating ourself and make our skill sets quite compatible for the market demands. We should have that much skill that no one can simply subtitute us. And even talking of AI ,it can't dominate in every field ,that's fine AI can do things it has also many limitations, at the end finally everything comes in out hand.
 
Now I want to conclude this with a note that that we the engineers are the creaters of these all stuffs so ultimately we enjoy the supremacy.
